✅ Task Manager Pro
Full CRUD App with Authentication

A full-stack task management application that allows users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their own tasks. Built to demonstrate authentication, protected routes, and full CRUD functionality in a real-world application.

🚀 Features

🔐 User authentication (Sign up & Login)

🛡️ Protected routes (only authenticated users can access the dashboard)

📝 Create, read, update, and delete tasks

👤 User-specific data (each user sees only their own tasks)

✅ Task status management (pending / completed)

💾 Persistent backend storage

🚪 Logout functionality

📱 Fully responsive dashboard UI

📂 How It Works

Users create an account or log in

Authentication creates a session and unlocks protected routes

Logged-in users access a personal dashboard

Tasks can be created, updated, marked complete, or deleted

All tasks are stored per user and persist across sessions

Logging out ends the session and blocks protected pages

🔐 Authentication Flow (High Level)

User submits login/signup form

Credentials are validated

Session is created

Protected routes check authentication status

User data is securely scoped to the logged-in user

🌱 Future Improvements

Password reset functionality

Task due dates and reminders

Role-based access (admin / user)

Backend API integration with external database

Notifications and activity tracking
